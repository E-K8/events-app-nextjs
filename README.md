This is a project for practicing Next JS essentials, creating structure and routes, setting components and styling them.

The app lets the user look for available events based on both year and month, it also catches most obvious errors (if event doesn't exist or route format is wrong).

Created along a tutorial within a Next JS course.

Things I haven't fixed yet: styling for Event Detail pages.
